	<p class="intro">
		‘Wherever you see a tattoo you see a loser,’ my dad said to me over the dinner table in 2002. I was 17 at the time and the subject had just come up. Little did my father know, coincidentally, that I was perched gingerly on one bum cheek because the other had been freshly tattooed with a small heart the size of a two pence piece; I was the human embodiment of a My Little Pony.
		<br>
		<br>
		Fast forward over a decade and while I agree with my Dad on many things, his generalising of tattoo wearers is not one of them; I'm sitting in the waiting area of the surprisingly sleek Bang Bang, a tattoo studio in New York named after its owner Keith ‘Bang Bang’ McCurdy.
		<br>
		<br>
		The go-to tattoo artist for everyone from Rihanna and Cara Delevingne,to Rita Ora, Justin Bieber and his current SO Selena Gomez, Bang Bang is kind of a big deal.
		<br>
		<br>
		We caught up with the tattoo legend to talk A-list inkings, charity auctions and giving Rihanna her first tattoo...

		<h1>DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A TATTOO ARTIST?</h1>
	</div>
	<p class="a1">I didn't always want to be a tattoo artist but as soon as I started I knew I only wanted to tattoo, it happened organically.</p>
	<h1 class="q2">HOW DID YOU GET INTO IT?</h1>
	<p class="a2">
		When I was eighteen I was still in high school and I bought a tattoo kit online - which is not what you're supposed to do, by the way, and I just taught myself. Eventually I got a job with someone in a real tattoo shop who taught me how to do it correctly and a year later, when I was 19, I moved to New York and have been here ever since.
	</p>
	<h1 class="q3">DID YOU TRAIN TO BE AN ARTIST?</h1>
	<p class="a3">
		I didn’t. I always had the ability to draw but never the training to draw. I was a little lazy about it until I started tattooing. I would draw something until I had it figured out then I’d stop drawing. Whereas with tattooing I have to finish the entire piece - I have no choice. So it was good for my ability, I got to grow because of that.
	</p>
	<h1 class="q4">WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE SECRET TO YOUR SUCCESS?</h1>
	<p class="a4">Just a good support system. I have great clients and friends and it really all comes from that. Everyone's heard my name because someone’s said it. I can’t stand on a mountain and tell everyone who I am, so it’s just friends, family, the whole circle.</p>
