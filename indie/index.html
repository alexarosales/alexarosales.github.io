	<h1>BANG <br> BANG</h1>
	<p>Keith "Bang Bang" McCurdy has been tattooing since he was in high school, when he practiced on friends, family, and himself before moving to New York. It was then that he committed to the profession for life by tattooing guns with the words Bang Bang on his neck, which is where he got his nickname. As he explained it, the move “basically ensured that I couldn’t get a job doing anything else,” forcing him to stick it out until he made it as a tattoo artist. “I wanted to be a great artist, so I didn’t give myself any other option but to become one,” he explained.

	With a few years, Bang Bang opened his own shop, and secured his first celebrity client, and today he’s New York’s most in-demand tattoo artist. Now, he’s just released a book, Bang Bang: My Life in Ink, about his life and art by combining hundreds of photos with his own personal anecdotes.</p>
