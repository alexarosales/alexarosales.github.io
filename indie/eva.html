	<p class="intro">
		While earning her Art Education degree in Ankara, she started doing street art and practice tattooing in a local shop. 
		<br><br>
		Eva says she'd never imagined that one day she'll be one of the most talked about tattoo artists in the world, but her style – particularly the intricate cross-stitch designs – won her a solid fan base, thousands of new followers, and global media coverage. 
		<br><br>
		Following the success of this newfound aesthetic, Eva developed another original design style – miniature sceneries contained in geometric shapes that kind of look like tiny framed paintings on her clients' skin.

		Besides her cross-stitch tattoos, beautifully contained landscapes and other poetic images, Eva is also well known for being a "skin counterfeiter" – a funny nickname symbolizing the fact that she can skillfully recreate some of the history's most famous artworks.
		<br>
		<br>
		Eva underlines that recreating someone else's work requires a deep sense of respect, so she tries to put herself in the artist's shoes, imagining every detail of their process, how they felt mixing the colors or selecting a brush
		<br>
		<br>
		The art enthusiast is prone to channeling her own feelings into her designs, capturing the spirit of her travels, people she meets or things that surround her
